internal class TransportParameters( // The server's preferred address is used to
    //      effect a change in server address at the end of the handshake, as
    //      described in Section 9.6.  This transport parameter is only sent
    //      by a server.  Servers MAY choose to only send a preferred address
    //      of one address family by sending an all-zero address and port
    //      (0.0.0.0:0 or [::]:0) for the other family.  IP addresses are
    //      encoded in network byte order.
    //
    //      The preferred_address transport parameter contains an address and
    //      port for both IP version 4 and 6.  The four-byte IPv4 Address
    //      field is followed by the associated two-byte IPv4 Port field.
    //      This is followed by a 16-byte IPv6 Address field and two-byte IPv6
    //      Port field.  After address and port pairs, a Connection ID Length
    //      field describes the length of the following Connection ID field.
    //      Finally, a 16-byte Stateless Reset Token field includes the
    //      stateless reset token associated with the connection ID.  The
    //      format of this transport parameter is shown in Figure 22.
    //
    //      The Connection ID field and the Stateless Reset Token field
    //      contain an alternative connection ID that has a sequence number of
    //      1; see Section 5.1.1.  Having these values sent alongside the
    //      preferred address ensures that there will be at least one unused
    //      active connection ID when the client initiates migration to the
    //      preferred address.
    //
    //      The Connection ID and Stateless Reset Token fields of a preferred
    //      address are identical in syntax and semantics to the corresponding
    //      fields of a NEW_CONNECTION_ID frame (Section 19.15).  A server
    //      that chooses a zero-length connection ID MUST NOT provide a
    //      preferred address.  Similarly, a server MUST NOT include a zero-
    //      length connection ID in this transport parameter.  A client MUST
    //      treat violation of these requirements as a connection error of
    //      payloadType TRANSPORT_PARAMETER_ERROR.
